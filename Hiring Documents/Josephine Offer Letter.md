Welcome to Foodnome, **FIRST_NAME**!

We are excited to extend an official offer for you to join the Foodnome team as **a/the TITLE**. This offer letter will go over the basics of working at Foodnome, but there are a lot more details in our [Employee Handbook](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook). If you have any questions that aren’t in this letter or the handbook, please let me know.

In our conversation, you said you wanted to take the **EQUITY/SALARY** heavy offer, so your starting salary will be **SALARY** per year and you will be recommended for an option to purchase **(91,428)/(85,714)** shares of Foodnome’s common stock. There are **11,428,563** shares of Foodnome common stock outstanding, and your shares will vest over four years, with a one year cliff.

Equity at startups is complicated, so we’ve created a [Guide to Your Equity](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Guide%20to%20Your%20Equity.md) that explains how options are issued, exercised, and what they might be worth if Foodnome is successful.

The best perk of working at Foodnome is your incredible new coworkers, but you’re also entitled to all of the benefits that apply to you from our benefits plan. These currently include:

- [Healthcare, Dental, Vision](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Healthcare%20and%20Disability%20Insurance.md)

- [Short and Long Term Disability Insurance](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Healthcare%20and%20Disability%20Insurance.md)

- [Three weeks vacation (15 days PTO)](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Vacation%20and%20Sick%20Leave.md)

- [Holidays](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Holiday%20List.md)

- [A two-month (8 week) paid sabbatical every 3 years working at Foodnome](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Sabbatical.md)

- [12 weeks paid new parent (maternity/paternity) leave](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/New%20Parent%20Leave.md)

- [Continuing education stipend for industry-related conferences, seminars, coaching, or mentorship activities](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Continuing%20Education.md)

- [Flights and hotels covered for speaking at industry conferences](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Continuing%20Education.md)

- [Unlimited Foodnome meal credit](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Benefits%20and%20Perks/Foodnome%20Meal%20Credit.md)

The benefits we offer will adapt to the team’s needs over time and we evaluate and adjust compensation at the beginning of each year (around January).

This position is full-time, so you should not take any other jobs without talking to us first. It’s also important that you avoid any work (paid or free) that interferes with your responsibilities at Foodnome or that might create a conflict of interest (like helping out or investing in a competitor or preparing to compete with Foodnome) unless Foodnome approves it in advance.

Foodnome is an "at-will" employer, which means that both you and Foodnome have the right to stop working together at any time, with or without advance notice, and for any reason (or for no reason). We also reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of employment including your position, pay, and benefits offered depending on the growth and needs of the company.

Our [Employee Handbook](https://github.com/foodnome/handbook) goes over the general policies and practices for working at Foodnome. This letter is specific to you and it supersedes the handbook if they conflict -- otherwise, the handbook is the authority on working at Foodnome.

But this letter doesn’t mean anything unless you sign it! And before this takes legal effect, you’ll need to fill out our [Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement](<https://github.com/foodnome/handbook/blob/master/Hiring%20Documents/Employee%20Proprietary%20Information%20and%20Inventions%20Assignment%20Agreement%20(NDA).doc.md>) and establish your identity and authorization to work in the country.

It has been great getting to know you through the interview process. The whole Foodnome team is convinced that you’re the right person for this job, and we can’t wait to work with you!

Foodnome, Inc.
